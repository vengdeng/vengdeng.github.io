Our  work **Token Hidden Reward: Steering Exploration-Exploitation in GRPO Training** has been selected as a **Best Paper** at the 2nd AI for Math Workshop @ ICML 2025. In this paper, we investigate how to guide the balance between exploitation and exploration in RL training using a free-launch token-level reward.
